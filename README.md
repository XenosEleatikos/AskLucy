## Usage
This library contains classes providing a ``__toString()`` method. By casting their instances with the ``(string)``
operator you will get clauses ready to use for Lucene search engine. For more details about the syntax of Lucene search
queries you may [read the official docs](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html). But the following
sections will give you all necessary information about building
such queries.

A query to Lucene search engine consists of one ore more clauses for matching documents. There are four types of clauses:
1. Terms matching documents that contain a single word.
2. Phrases matching documents that contain a sequence of words.
3. Ranges matching documents that contain a value between a lower and an upper bound.
4. Complex queries containing one or more sub-clauses of any type.

### Creating Clauses
#### Creating a Term
To create a query matching documents that contain a single word, e. g. "word", just build a new ```Term``` as follows:

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$term = Lucene::term('word');
```
The string representation of the query will be:

> word

#### Creating a Phrase
To create a clause matching documents that contain a sequence of words, e. g. "Lucene search", you can instantiate a new
```Phrase``` with the following snippet:

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$phrase = Lucene::phrase('Lucene query');
```

The string representation of the query will be:

> "Lucene query"

#### Creating a Range
To create a range matching documents that contain a value between a lower and an upper bound, instantiate a new
```Rage``` with the bounds:

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$range = Lucene::range('alpha', 'omega');
```

The string representation of the query will be:

> [alpha TO omega]

#### Creating a Complex Query
To create a complex query containing one or more clauses of any type, instantiate a new ```Query``` and add clauses:

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$phrase = Lucene::query()
    ->add(Lucene::term('word'))
    ->add(Lucene::phrase('Lucene query'));
```

The string representation of the query will be:

> word "Lucene query"

### Fields
For all types of clauses you can specify a field to search in by calling the method ```setField()``` or by adding an
additional parameter to the factory method.

#### Setting a Field to a Term
To search for documents containing "Lucene" in the (field named) "title", use the following snippet:

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$term = Lucene::term('Lucene');
$term->setField('title');
```

As a shortcut you may also set the field directly by adding a second parameter to the factory:

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$term = Lucene::term('Lucene', 'title');
```

Both lead to the same result:

> title:Lucene

#### Setting a Field to a Phrase
You can specify a field to search in by calling the method ```setField()```...

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$phrase = Lucene::phrase('Search Engine');
$phrase->setField('title');
```

... or you can set the field by adding a second parameter to the factory:

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$phrase = Lucene::phrase('Search Engine', 'title');
```

The result is the same:

> title:"Search Engine"

#### Setting a Field to a Range
Specify a field to search the value range in by calling the method ```setField()```...

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$range = Lucene::range('Anna', 'Doro');
$range->setField('name');
```

... or set the field by adding a third parameter to the factory:

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$range = Lucene::range('Anna', 'Doro', 'name');
```

The result is the same:

> name:[Anna TO Dora]

#### Setting Fields in Complex Queries
As before you can specify a search field by calling the method ```setField()```...

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$query = Lucene::query()
    ->add(Lucene::term('Lucene'))
    ->add(Lucene::term('Apache'));
$query->setField('title');
```

... or by passing a parameter to the factory:

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$query = Lucene::query('title')
    ->add(Lucene::term('Lucene'))
    ->add(Lucene::term('Apache'));
```

In both cases the string representation of the query will be:

> title:(Lucene Apache)

Note, that the brackets are set automatically, if more than one sub-clauses were set. If you want to specify a field
just for a certain sub-clause, you may do this:

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$query = Lucene::query()
    ->add(Lucene::term('Lucene', 'title'))
    ->add(Lucene::term('Apache'));
```

The result will be:

> title:Lucene Apache

### Operators
For all types of clauses you can add operators to define, if matching is required, prohibited or optional. Just call
```required()```, ```prohibited()```, or ```optional()```. Note, that a clause is optional by default, so that calling
```optional()``` is optional. But it can be used to override an operator set before.

#### Setting an Operator to a Term
To require the word "PHP" necessarily, use the following snippet...

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$term = Lucene::term('PHP')
    ->required();
```

... and get:

> +PHP

To prohibit the word "Java", do this...

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$term = Lucene::term('Java')
    ->prohibited();
```

... and you'll get that:

> -Java

#### Setting an Operator to a Phrase
You can add operators to phrases in the same manner as to terms.

Require a phrase necessarily...

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$phrase = Lucene::phrase('Lucene query')
    ->required();
```

... and get the string representation:

> +"Lucene query"

Prohibit the phrase...

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$phrase = Lucene::phrase('Java development')
    ->prohibited();
```

... and get:

> -"Java development"

#### Setting an Operator to a Range
Adding operators to ranges works in the same way as adding them to the other kinds of clauses.

Require a value of a range necessarily...

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$range = Lucene::range('Anna', 'Doro')
    ->required();
```

... and get the string representation:

> +[Anna TO Doro]

Prohibit a value of the range...

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$range = Lucene::range('Anna', 'Doro')
    ->prohibited();
```

... and get:

> -[Anna TO Doro]

#### Setting Operators in Complex Queries
You can add operators to complex queries right as to terms and phrases:

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$phrase = Lucene::query()
    ->add(Lucene::term('Lucene'))
    ->add(Lucene::phrase('search query'))
    ->required();
```

The query will match all documents containing necessarily "Lucene" or "search query" (or both). The string representation will
be:

> +(Lucene "search query")

Instead of creating sub-clauses, setting operators to them and finally adding them to a complex query, you can use
```Query::shouldHave()```, ```Query::mustHave()``` or ```Query::mustNotHave()```, what automatically sets the "optional",
"required" or "prohibited" operator to the given sub-queries.

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$query = Lucene::query()
    ->shouldHave(Lucene::term('word'))
    ->mustHave(Lucene::phrase('Lucene query'))
    ->mustNotHave(Lucene::phrase('Java development'));
```

The string representation of the query will be:

> word +"Lucene query" -"Java development"

### Relevance Boosting
You can add a "boost" to a clause of any type, to make it more relevant. Just call ```boost()``` with a boost factor
greater than zero.

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$term = Lucene::term('Lucene');
$term->boost(2.5);

$phrase = Lucene::phrase('search engine')
    ->boost(2);

$query = Lucene::query()
    ->add(Lucene::term('Apache'))
    ->add($term)
    ->add($phrase);
```

The result will be:

> Apache Lucene^2.5 "search engine"^2

### Fuzziness

You can do a fuzzy search term by calling ```Term::fuzzify()```:

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$term = Lucene::term('word')
    ->fuzzify();
```

The string representation of the query will be:

> word~

The fuzzy search is based on Damerau-Levenshtein Distance, that is the number of single character edits allowed to reach
the search term. By using the optional parameter, you can define that distance:

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$term = Lucene::term('word')
    ->fuzzify(1);
```

The string representation of the query will be:

> word~1

The query will also match terms like "Ford", that can be reached by edit a single character of the search term. The
default value of ```fuzzify()``` is 2, so that also words like "nerd" will be matched. By using 0 as parameter, fuzzy search
is disabled, what is the same as just don't calling ```fuzzify()```. Allowed values are 0, 1 and 2.

### Proximity Search
You can specify a maximum distance to find terms, that are near each other in a document. For example, if you search for
the terms "search" and "term" within five words, create the following phrase:  

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$phrase = Lucene::phrase('search term')
    ->setProximity(5);
```

The string representation of the query will be:

> "search term"~5

The proximity 0 means exact matching and, as the Lucene default value, must not be rendered. The proximity 1 would
allow interchanging words, "term search".

### Range Search
Ranges matching documents that contain a value between a lower and an upper bound. They can be inclusive or exclusive of
the bounds.

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$range = Lucene::range('Alpha', 'Omega')
    ->inclusive();
```

This clause matches documents that contain values between "Alpha" and "Omega" inclusive "Alpha" and "Omega". The clause
will be rendered with square brackets.

> [Alpha TO Omega]

Note, that ranges are inclusive by default, so that you don't have to call ```Range::inclusive()```.
You can make the range exclusive of the bounds by calling ```Range::exclusive()```:

```php
<?php
use AskLucy\Lucene;

$range = Lucene::range('Alpha', 'Omega')
    ->exclusive();
```

The clause will be rendered with curly brackets:

> {Alpha TO Omega}
